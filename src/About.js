      <h2>About</h2>
      Get tough with it, get strong. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit
      is. We need dark in order to show light. This is probably the greatest
      thing that's ever happened in my life. Let's put some happy little clouds
      in our world. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Use what you
      see, don't plan it. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all
      about. The light is your friend. Preserve it. A thin paint will stick to a
      thick paint. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.'
      And you may be right. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in
      your world. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. We don't really
      know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Isn't that
      fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? How do you make a
      round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. You
      better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. You can do
      anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. We'll
      throw some happy little limbs on this tree. This is your creation - and
      it's just as unique and special as you are.
